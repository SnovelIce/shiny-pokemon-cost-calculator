# shiny-pokemon-cost-calculator
on this script you can put a pokemon name and it will tell you the average of all the sells of that pokemon in shiny(in pokemon go)

also its gonna help how to get all the sales of an item in Ebay

-----How to Modify----
1. how to change the limit of cost per item: I did it a 1000( in line 32) because it will most likely to be an acc of a user who has that pokemon then the actual pokemon. 
2. how to filter words in title per item: i did that it will filter the words "lv" and "level" because (again) it will most likely to be an acc of a user who has that pokemon then the actual pokemon.
3. how to change currency from the cost per pokemon: i don't think that you can change it from the URL so you can use some kind of api like https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/USD
